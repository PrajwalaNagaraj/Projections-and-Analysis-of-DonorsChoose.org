# Donors-Choose-Analysis-Application
Our project is aimed to work on the dataset given by DonorsChoose.org to draw analysis and give a collective information on the data over time spread through various entities involved. The website that we develop plans to give cumulative information of the data for teachers, for users or donors and for the admin of DonorsChoose.org separately helping each one to understand how are the trends and where can they add more efforts to simplify the process and maximize the donations as early as possible. Adding this level of analysis and projections about the process can also provide a positive influence for users willing to donate by upholding the transparency of the system enabling more donations for projects.

Dataset:

The dataset on DonorsChoose has six tables cumulatively adding up to 4GB of data with more than 100,000 records. The tables are:
•	Donations – information involves donor donating to projects over time.
•	Donors – information on the donors, their origins and if they are the teachers or not.
•	Projects – information about project involves the teacher requesting it, project’s description, type of category (based on resources) it belongs to, time gap between posting project and its expiration, current status of project and the date when project was fully funded.
•	Resources – information on the source of resources, the projects it goes to and the price individually it requires.
•	Schools – information involves the school type based on its location and its location.
•	Teachers – information on the teacher’s requesting the project along with the date of project request submission.
